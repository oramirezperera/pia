This is a scraper to get information from the web :globe_with_meridians:

## Getting Started

You need Python 3.xx or more to run this program

I really recommend using a virtualenvironment to run this program

```
$ python3 -m venv 'name of your environment'
```
Then you can activate your virtual environment

Windows
```
'name of your environment'\Scripts\activate
```

Linux
```
$ source 'name of your environment'/bin/activate
```

### Pre-requisites

- Python3.6 or higher
- scrapy

## Running

To run this program you need to type 
```
scrapy crawl cia
```

This will return a json file called

cia.json

With all the information scraped from the website

you can see the information displayed as a webpage [here](https://oramirezperera.github.io/pia_web/)
